We also definitely need to add in a page or tab or section for things like slayer tasks , chance drops / items / treasure scrolls and the walkthroughs, maybe a tab for quests and the walkthroughs, utilising other already compiled helpful things like that we can add in on the side, users are always looking up things like how to do quests or where to go for this or that, if you can also do a good browse across multiple forums mentioning osrs and old school RuneScape and preferably more recent posts or mentions, and see what a common theme is with users and what they're talking about or asking questions about or asking help for, that will give us a better idea on what content we can add in that users are interested in or are actively needing at their disposal, also the ability on another page or tab to have a little pixel detect / ocr image tool that can maybe put a sizeable box or Draggable window or coloured square or rectangle on a users screen and maybe have the user be able to hover and select (mouse hover and space to capture) items or colours or icons or be it potions or monsters or even trees for woodcutting, but just. Little gui for the user to map with the hover and select, items on screen within a coloured window they can adjust over their game and have the ai integration or just like an auto clicker /key presser or whatever the user needs to click, or press, be able to do that within the window, or even if they want to automate the pressing and holding and then releasing of w a s d to walk and click items within that drawn boundary maybe the chance of automating that. It would just take a little detection or image detection or ocr or the combination of an auto clicker / key presser clicking items in an order or randomly if the users chooses, repeatedly in the same spot might be for crafting items then clicking the bank to deposit them then clicking the items then depositing etc, or randomly might be randomly wandering in the drawn area or window with w a S d just being held down or pressed every now and then and clicking in a random pattern in that boundary to chop trees or kill cows or something like that, some sort of good functional tool that could be multi functional to click repeatedly, click repeatedly but in maybe random pattern or circular, "walk" using the wasd but not leaving the boundary and having the tool stop if it goes outside it or too close to it while also clicking or the repeated clicking of an item in one spot then the clicking of another spot like for the bank , just a really flexible gui with the ability to do something like that would be fantastic, especially if we could get our ai integrated to be able to make things even better, but I know I'm asking a lot haha! But even if we can get a tab with the monsters and their levels and what they drop, the grand exchange and the current prices of items a user can look up and see without having to physically go there, best spots for imp catching or hunting or whatever, just those additions would put the cherry on top. I'm blown away by what you've done you're really absolutely fantastic it's above and beyond my expectations!
